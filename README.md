# H1-B-VISA-APPROVAL

The H1-B Visa is the most sought-after non-immigrant visa that allows foreign workers to work in the United States in a speciality occupation.
In 2019, more than 1 million applicants applied for an H-1B visa including new applications, renewals and transfer of H1-B to
another company. There were more than 180,000 new applicants for H1-B, however, only 80,000 applications were picked up in
the lottery process for taking it further to USCIS for approval. 

The uncertainty in getting an H1-B visa creates employment and legal status uncertainties for a job application, as well as high legal and
visa processing fees for the organization throughout employment. We plan to use an anonymized dataset for 2019 that
United States Department of Labor publishes publicly. We'll apply data science techniques to improve the predictability of approval in this scenario.
